## Introduction

This project is a port of an Apple ][ game I wrote in the 1980's. The [original](assets/original_miner.txt) was written in UCSD Pascal.

The original Miner game was the first time I had ever done "structured programming" (as they use to call it), and I had no formal training yet, so it isn't pretty (although it is much more readable than my AppleSoft BASIC code from the same era). It was inspired by a Commodore PET ASCII-based game of the same name.

# Credits

I originally started with Herbert Wolverson's Rogue Toolkit [Bracket-Lib](https://github.com/amethyst/bracket-lib), which makes 2D game development really simple. I later refactored it to use [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) instead.

I also based a lot of the code on what I learned in his book [Hands-on Rust](https://pragprog.com/titles/hwrust/hands-on-rust/), which is a fantastic (and fun!) learning resource.
