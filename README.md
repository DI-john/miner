## Introduction

This project is a port of a Apple ][ game I wrote in the 1980's. The [original](assets/original_miner.txt) was written in UCSD Pascal. It was the first time I had ever done "structured programming" (as they use to call it), and I had no formal training yet, so it isn't pretty (although much more readable than my AppleSoft BASIC code from the same era).

This rewrite is part of my learning journey in Rust.
